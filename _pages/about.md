**Lalitaditya Divakarla**

I am a Ph.D. Researcher in Computer Science at the University of Minnesota, specializing in Digital Twins and Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). My research focuses on building AI-powered Digital Twin systems that integrate 5G/NextG networking and C-V2X technologies to enable safe, reliable, and scalable future mobility solutions.

My work combines expertise in artificial intelligence, networking, robotics, and transportation systems. I develop innovative approaches to create real-time digital representations of autonomous vehicles and their environments, enabling better decision-making and safety in autonomous driving scenarios.

I'm passionate about advancing the field of intelligent transportation systems and welcome collaborations in Digital Twins for CAVs, 5G/NextG networking, and C-V2X technologies.
